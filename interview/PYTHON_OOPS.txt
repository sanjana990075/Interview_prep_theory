why we need oops?
--is usefull for breaking down the complex systems into smaller ones,more mangeable components.
oops also ensures code resuability, and provides data security

what are access specifiers? significance?
access modifiers are the special keywords which are used to control the accessibility of entities like classes,methods etc(public private protected)

main features of oops and pillars

inheritance(real world,techincal example)
--it allows one class to inherit the properties the properties of other class.increases the code resuability

Encapsulation
--core principles of oops.it refers to bundling of data and methods tht operates on data into a single unit is known as Encapsulation

polymorphism
--Polymorphism in Python is the ability of the same function or method to behave differently for different objects or data types.

compile time polymorphism - function overloading
run time polymorphism - function overriding

abstraction
--one of the fundamental principles of oop tht mainly focuses on hiding the implmentation details and exposing nly the essential features
